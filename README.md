## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- HTML Table
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I was not very familiar with the html table, and that was the way I went with the small nutrition box at the bottom. I understand from a semantic perspective this is a better choice that the more responsive grid or flexgrid.

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.



### Continued development

At this point, each time I build a new page I am reinforcing the stuff I've learned. I can't say how helpful this has been. I am also interesting in understanding more about responsive layouts and using DATA in my web sites - although I believe this will involve more javascript that I've been doing.

### Useful resources

I continue to use : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/ for general info on how to use html and css elements.
